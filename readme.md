## Disentangling via multi-tasking: Models and analysis

This code relies on code from my other repositories:

```
nms_error-correction
general-neural
superposition_codes
```

It is all
written in Python 3, making
extensive use of the Python scientific computing environment. Further
dependencies include:
1. numpy  
2. scipy  
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib  
5. pandas  
6. tensorflow  

All are available via pip. With any questions on how to navigate this code or
about the manuscript, please
feel free to contact [me](https://wj2.github.io/).

### Generating figures from Johnston and Fusi (2021)
This code underlies all of the figures in Johnston and Fusi
(2021) https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.20.465187 . Unfortunately, many of the
figure panels rely on computationally expensive simulations. I will make the
data from these simulations publicly available soon. In 
the mean time, feel free to contact [me](https://wj2.github.io/) and I will
share them. 

If you want to understand how a figure was generated, the code is located 
in ```figures.py```.
